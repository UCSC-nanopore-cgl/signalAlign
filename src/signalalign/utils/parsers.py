"""
This is a module of FASTA/.qual and FASTQ parsers.
The functions in this module are intended for use with biological sequence data
(DNA, and amino acid) in the form of FASTA, .qual (which accompany FASTA),
and FASTQ files. There are two kinds of functions in this module, Readers and
Makers.
Readers:
In general, a reader function accepts an argument which points to the file(s)
to be parsed and then any options associated with that kind of file.
For example:
To parse a FASTQ file (ex, fake.fq64) that has phred-64/solexa quality encoding;
>>>read_fastq('fake.fq64', offset=64, solexa=True)
This function yields a tuple in with the internal format:
    ('sequence identifier', 'comment', 'sequence', [Q-value])
    'sequence identifier' = the string following the '@' or '>' in FASTA up
                            until the first space (' ')
    'comment' = everything else on the first line after the sequence title
    'sequence' = the sequence (nucleotide, FASTA, FASTQ or amino acid FASTA)
    [Q-value] = all of the functions in this module convert to a common quality
                score which is defined as Q=-10(log10(Perror))
Makers:
These functions are intended to be used with the Reader functions included in
this module. In general they accept an argument in the form of a generator
(the Reader function), an output destination (default is sys.stdout) and any
options associated with making that kind of file (ex. FASTQ offset).
For example:
To make a FASTA and .qual file from a FASTQ with phred-64 quality encoding that
prints to two files out.fasta and out.qual;
>>>make_fasta_and_qual(read_fastq('fake.fq64', offset=64),
                       outfasta='out.fasta',
                       outqual='out.qual)
Limitations (and expansions):
None of these parsers check to make sure the files make sense. In other words,
if you have a FASTQ with letters that aren't in the alphabet associated with
nucleotide sequence, the parser will not recognize them.  Similarly with quality
values, these parsers will not guess what encoding the input file is using or
sanity check whether the quality values make sense.
Basically, if you put garbage in, you'll get garbage out. But hopefully it will
be correctly parsed and formatted garbage.
Some edge conditions are accepted; no identifier string for example, and will
simply propagate as empty strings for the title.  If you're only interested in
converting from one format to another quickly, than this shouldn't be too much
of a problem.  If there is no sequence data, these entries will propagate as
empty entries.
